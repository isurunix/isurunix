# Hey there! 👋 I'm Isuru

Welcome to my corner of the coding universe! I'm a **Lead Developer & Associate Technical Specialist** at **Wiley**, passionate about building scalable systems that actually work in the real world.

## 🚀 What I Do

I lead agile teams in crafting enterprise-grade distributed systems. Think of me as the guy who turns complex requirements into elegant, scalable solutions that your future self will thank you for.

**Currently obsessed with:**
- Building microservices that don't hate each other 🤝
- Making DevOps pipelines so smooth they practically run themselves ⚙️
- Architecting cloud solutions that scale like magic ☁️

## 🛠️ My Tech Arsenal

```java
public class IsursBrain {
    private String[] primaryStack = {
        "Java", "Spring Boot", "Microservices",
        "AWS", "Docker", "Kafka", "MySQL"
    };
    
    private String[] dailyTools = {
        "Linux", "Git", "Agile", "CI/CD"
    };
    
    private String currentFocus = "Software Architecture";
}
```

## 🌟 What You'll Find Here

- **Learning & Experimentation**: Personal projects where I explore new technologies and concepts
- **GraphQL Adventures**: Spring Boot + GraphQL and React + GraphQL demos for modern API development
- **DevOps Utilities**: Docker setups and deployment scripts that make development life easier
- **Academic Projects**: University collaborations like the OUSL Online Activity Diary system
- **Local Solutions**: Sri Lankan-focused projects like train schedules (because we all need to catch that train!)
- **Development Tools**: Handy scripts and configurations that solve real-world problems

## 📝 Beyond the Code

When I'm not deep in distributed systems, you'll find me:
- Writing about software development on [my blog](#) 📖
- Watching movies (yes, even the bad ones) 🍿
- Reading everything from sci-fi to technical documentation 📚
- Sharing knowledge with the dev community 🤝

## 💡 Fun Fact

I believe the best code is the code you don't have to write twice. Also, coffee is a food group in software development. ☕
