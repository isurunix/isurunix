# Hey there! üëã I'm Isuru

I'm a full-stack engineer, passionate about building scalable systems that work in the real world.

## What I Do

I learn, I think, and I code

**Currently obsessed with:**
- Learning new things every day
- Building microservices that don't hate each other
- Designing software solutions that are scalable and maintainable
- Experimenting with AI-aided coding tools

## My Tech Stack

```java
public class IsursBrain {
    private String[] primaryStack = {
        "Java", "Spring Boot", "Microservices",
        "AWS", "Docker", "Kafka", "MySQL"
    };
    
    private String[] dailyTools = {
        "Linux", "Git", "Agile", "CI/CD"
    };
    
    private String currentFocus = "Software Architecture";
}
```

## What You'll Find Here

- **Learning & Experimentation**: Personal projects where I explore new technologies and concepts
- **Utilities**: Different development setups and deployment scripts that make development life easier
- **Academic Projects**: Things I did during my undergraduate days
- **Pet Projects**: Small pet projects that I do now and then when inspiration stuck my brain
- **Development Tools**: Handy scripts and configurations that solve real-world problems

## Beyond the Code

When I'm not deep in distributed systems, you'll find me:
- Writing about software development on [my blog](https://isurubuddhika.dev) 
- Watching movies (yes, even the bad ones)
- Reading everything from sci-fi to technical documentation
- Sharing knowledge with the dev community
